    desc2:"Despite the challenges she faced, Naniji never wavered in her determination to provide for her family. She migrated from a village in Rajasthan to Kolkata, single-handedly raising her three daughters and two sons. Her unwavering spirit and infectious laughter were a constant source of inspiration for us all.",
