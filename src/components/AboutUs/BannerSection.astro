        Our Inspiration: <br>A Legacy of Love and Resilience

      Savitri Devi Sharma, our beloved Naniji, was a woman of extraordinary strength and resilience. Married at the tender age of 16 in pre-independence India, she faced the unimaginable loss of her husband at just 24, leaving her to raise five children alone.

    <p class="text-[16px] lg:text-[18px] leading-[28px] text-[#222222] pb-6 lg:pb-8">
      Despite the challenges she faced, Naniji never wavered in her determination to provide for her family. She migrated from a village in Rajasthan to Kolkata, single-handedly raising her three daughters and two sons. Her unwavering spirit and infectious laughter were a constant source of inspiration for us all.
    </p>
    <p class="text-[16px] lg:text-[18px] leading-[28px] text-[#222222]">
      Tragically, we lost Naniji to a fall in the bathroom. This heartbreaking event sparked a realisation: falls are a significant risk for older adults, and many can be prevented. It is in honour of Naniji's legacy that we founded EyEagle.
